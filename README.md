# Bubble
We are a group of young, enthusiastic individuals who aim to make a difference and help the underprivileged. "Bubble" is an initiative where we distribute bags to flats in apartments and collect ration items like rice, daal, and clothes every month. Nearby children's homes in need receive these contributions. Bubble was started by a duo of siblings - Anusha Chaturvedi and Rishit Chaturvedi, based out of Bangalore.
